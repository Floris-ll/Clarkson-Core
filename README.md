# Clarkson Core
A plugin to write Object-Oriented code in combination with the Twig templating engine while keeping the WordPress Way of working in mind.

## Documentation and getting started
Check out the [getting started with Clarkson Core guide](https://level-level.github.io/Clarkson-Core/phpdoc/guide/index.html) if you are just getting to know the project.

## Overview

### Installation
```
composer require level-level/clarkson-Core
```

or read the [installation guide](https://level-level.github.io/Clarkson-Core/phpdoc/guide/getting-started/installation.html).

### Template Hierachy
Uses the internal [Template Hierarchy](https://level-level.github.io/Clarkson-Core/phpdoc/guide/getting-started/templating.html) so you can replace `index.php` with `index.twig` or `archive-company.php` with `archive-company.twig` and still have all Posts or CPT's available in "The Loop".


```twig
{% extends "layouts/full-width.twig" %}

{% block content %}
    {% for object in objects %}
        {% include 'partials/teaser.twig' %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

### Autoloading of WordPress-object classes per Custom Post Type.
It autoloads a default objects that behave just like `WP_Post` and other native WordPress object but with some more handy stuff.
When you register a Custom Post Type `ll_company` your custom class `ll_company` gets loaded in the Twig context as `objects` variable within the `archive-company.twig`.
